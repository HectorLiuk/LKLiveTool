### Pull Requests

We gladly accept any PR's assuming they are well written, documented ( if necessary ) and preferably have test code. If you're unsure if we'll accept a new feature please open an issue requesting it and we can have a discussion before you code and submit a PR.

### Issues

Please use the issue tracker *strictly* for bugs you think are caused by a code issue in SnapKit. We’re very busy and as a free open source library do not have the time to adequately help with questions that are more tutorial/training in nature and recommend using Stack Overflow and Google as alternatives.

Please do not be offended if we close your issue and reference this document. If you believe the issue is truely a fault in SnapKit’s codebase re-open it.
